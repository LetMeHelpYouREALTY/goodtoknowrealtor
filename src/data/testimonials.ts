    fullQuote: "After losing 3 homes to cash buyers and bidding wars, we were exhausted and ready to give up. Dr. Jan found an off-market property in Summerlin that matched our vision exactly—and negotiated our first offer accepted, $50K UNDER asking price (not over). We closed in 18 days, stress-free, and saved enough to renovate the kitchen.",

Dr. Jan's pre-listing staging overhaul (she brought in professional designers) and aggressive pricing strategy generated 8 competing offers in just 6 days. We accepted $125K over asking—enough to buy our Arizona retirement home in cash, no mortgage needed.",

    fullQuote: "I was buying random properties based on Zillow listings and losing money every month. Dr. Jan mapped out emerging Las Vegas neighborhoods before they peaked, found 3 undervalued properties with forced-appreciation potential, and structured deals that cash-flowed from day one. My portfolio is now $2.3M, generating $8,200/month passive income—up 340% from my first struggling property. Her market timing isn't luck; it's strategic.",

Dr. Jan leveraged her private network to access an off-market listing in The Ridges that matched our exact specifications (mountain views, 3-car garage, pool). We negotiated directly with the seller, avoided bidding wars entirely, and closed at fair market value: $1.2M for a home that would've cost $1.4M+ in a public listing frenzy.",

Dr. Jan's comparative market analysis pinpointed the sweet spot, and her professional photography + 3D virtual tours attracted 12 showings from California buyers in the first week. We accepted an offer $95K above our original target, closed in 14 days, and used the proceeds to upgrade to a larger home.",

Dr. Jan's rigorous due diligence process (inspections, title searches, tenant history reviews) flagged red flags we missed.
